# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Variables
		* A variable is a thing that holds a value that is referenced later in a program. The value holds just about anything - words, numbers, true/false values.
	* Strings
		* A string is a type of variable that holds text (characters or words).
	* Functions (arguments, `return`)
		* A function is a block of code that does a specific thing and allows that code to be re-used & called from elsewhere in the program without having to write out the code multiple times. Arguments are values that you give a function that it may need to process its code. This lets you re-use the function for different situations. A return value is a value that a function gives back to the main program after being called.
	* `if` statements
		* "If" statements let you test for conditions and execute a block of code if it results in a true value. If yourPet == 'cat' then noiseItMakes = 'purrs'. When the If statement results in a false value, the block of code is ignored and another block (called Else) will be executed instead. 
	* Boolean values (`true`, `false`)
		* A boolean value is a value that holds whether something is true or not. This can be used to test for certain conditions just like any other variable. Ex: if (hasEatenDinner == true) { getsIceCream = true; }


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Install SublimeText3.  If you have another editor that you prefer then you can use that. https://www.sublimetext.com/3


4. Download this project folder from GitHub.


5. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


6. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


7. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
